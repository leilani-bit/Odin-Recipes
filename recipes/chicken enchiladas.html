    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is one I created with multiple recipes that I tweaked over time. The homemade sauce is what really sets this dish
            apart from other recipes. It can be very spicy depending on that years pick of green chiles. If you're lucky enough to live
            in an area that sells fresh roasted green chiles: Buy them in bulk (you can keep the leftovers prepped in your freezer)!</p>
        <p>The Following recipe is quick and easy! Perfect for a beginner or someone looking for a simple yet delicious dinner. To make
            it even easier you can use store bought enchilada sauce. I don't necessarily recommend doing so but pick a good sauce and 
            you'll be set for a yummy dinner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>1 Full rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>24 count corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>16 oz shredded jack cheese</li>
         </ul>
    <h2>Sauce Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>1 white onion</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 16 oz container chicken broth</li>
            <li>8oz roasted green chiles</li>
            <li>2 jalape√±os</li>
            <li>1 TBsp oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375</li>
            <li>First, prep the chicken by shredding it into chunks. Put aside in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Shred the cheese and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make sauce (i don't feel like writing all this out)</li>
            <li>Prep the tortillas. Do this by adding vegetable oil a little at a time to a small frying pan on med high heat. Wait
                for the first bit oil to heat to a smoking temp. Then, lightly fry the tortillas. Repeat this step for all tortillas adding
                oil as needed. </li>
            <li>With all the Ingredients prepped it is time to start assembling the enchiladas. Add a heaping spoonful of the enchilada sauce 
                to the bottom of a 13x9 pan. For each enchilada get a tortilla spread a spoonful of sauce, some chicken, and cheese and roll it
                up. The amount you fill it with is up to you! </li>
            <li>Repeat the following step until you have filled the pan.</li>
            <li>Finally, cover the rolled enchiladas with as much sauce as you'd like. I make sure mine are completely covered so they don't 
                get dry. Top with cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 min or until cheese is a light golden brown.</li>
            
        </ol>
